These practices can be continued daily after the workshops.

Users of this website will find all the necessary information about Sanctuary: details about the studio, its location, contact information, an introduction to the yoga tradition offered, and a registration form. This site is targeted toward individuals who want to take the next step in their spiritual journey.
